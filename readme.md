##Project Notes

PetPals is a social media-type site that gives users the ability to post pictures and statuses as pets they create. A full MEN stack, dynamic application with a fun and playful concept.

##Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Amazon Web Services
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Node.js
- Express

##Process

We started out by sketching out very detailed descriptions of our models and views. Almost all of our first day was spent ironing out our primary requirements for the functional application, the features we'd like to add to the MVP if possible, and talking out some of our preliminary logic for more difficult aspects of the site.

Next we split up with some of us focusing on routing and others focusing on views, allowing us to each work independently compromising the ability for our code to work together.

Finally, upon finishing our most basic MVP, we each assigned ourselves some smaller issues in the program to address, as well as taking on a feature that we personally really wanted to attempt to implement.

##Future Developments

We have a lot of developments we'd like to implement in the future.

Add a 'Purr and Grrr' feature (likes&dislikes) that utilizes AJAX

Add the ablity to follow individual pets and view a feed of posts made by only those pets

Create an 'event' system where pets can schedule playdates with each other
